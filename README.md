# blenderUmap
After messing around with programs like fmodel, and umodel, I had wanted to get a look at maps themselves,
though since their existed a program from the looks of it design for either valorant or fortnite I took it upon myself to create a simple
program just using blender to recreate some maps, now anyone attempting to do it yourself some changes probably will have to be made, so know what one map at least looks like will help increadibly.
